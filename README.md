This is an introduction and basics for python as well as coding as whole.
In this tutorial, I will mainly be focused on very basic computing theory needed to begin coding.

# Out of Scope
I will not be discussing anything dives deep into the theory of computation or discrete mathematics.
I will not be discussing matrix mathematics or implementations of calculus.
I will not be discussing 'efficiency' and optimization problems (reducing big O, etc.)

# Agenda
1. What is programming?
-> How does it relate to computer science
-> How does Python relate
1.1. How to install python
-> Traditional
-> Anaconda
-> Hello, World!
2. Basic (Primitive) data types
-> Integers
-> Floating Point
`-> Longs, Shorts
-> characters
`-> strings
-> Voids
-> Implicit vs. Explicit Casting
-> How Python handles data types
3. Composite Data Types (Structures)
-> Arrays
-> Dictionaries
-> Maps
4. Classes and Objects
-> TBD
